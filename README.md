# Utility Potion

This mod adds a number of utility spells if you want to explore the game. This is a bit like [ChooseYourStats](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/206), except this is meant to be casted once and apply a group of useful statuses, as well as grant utility spells.

Those spells are cheats. They are meant to facilitate exploration, not be used in combat.

## How to install

You can call the Powershell script from your terminal, as long as you added your `{LSlib Folder}/Tools` to your PATH in environment variables beforehand. See [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44272416/how-to-add-a-folder-to-path-environment-variable-in-windows-10-with-screensho) or [here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=add+to+edit+path+windows+11).
